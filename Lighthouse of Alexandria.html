            <p>
              The lighthouse of Alexandria, or "Pharos" of Alexandria, was an ancient marvel 
              located on the eastern tip of Pharos, Egypt. Built by Ptolomy II in the 3rd century BC,
              it served as a guiding light for sailors, it was a symbol of technological advancement,
              architectural grandeur, and martime prowess for over a thousand years.

            <p>
              The Lighthouse was an architectural masterpiece, designed and constructed by Greek
              architect Sostratus. It consisted of 3 sections: The Base, which was used as the base of operations for the keepers
              as well as their living quarters. The mid-section, covered in decorations. The top, which soared
              115 meters in the sky, topped with a statue of the Sea God Poseidon.

            <p>
             What made the Lighthouse so remarkable was the technology. A sophisticated mirror system
             was employed to produce a powerful beam of light at night, guiding ships. They reflected sunlight
             during the day and became a fire source during the night, creating a brilliant and 
             visible beacon from miles away.

            <p>
              For centuries, the Lighthouse remained as one of the Seven Wonders, captivating visitors from 
              around the world. It played a crucial role in trade, prosperity and navigation. However,
              the passage of time and a series of earthquakes damaged it significantly. As such, it completely dissapeared 
              by the 15th century, about 600 years ago.
