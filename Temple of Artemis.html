              The Temple, once again, showcased the architectural skills of the Greeks.

            <p>
              The temple served as a focal point of religion. Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt,
              was one of the most central figures in Greek mythology. The temple attracted visitors from all around
              the ancient world, where rituals and ceremonies were held. There were many gifts, sacrifices,
              offerings towards the temple. It was also believed that it had healing powers, but that's just myth.

            <br />
            <p>
              The Temple fell victim to several calamities throughout its existance. in 345 BC, a man named
              Herostratus set it on fire, seeking fame. However, the temple was completely rebuilt, even more glorious
              than before. But in 262 CE, the temple was destroyed by the Germanic Goths. The temple was looted,
              burned, and now it lays in ruins. Despite this, it left a huge mark on history, and its grandeur
              is well documented in ancient texts.
