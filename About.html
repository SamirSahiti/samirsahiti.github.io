          <h3>What are the 7 wonders of the world?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            The 7 wonders of the world are lists gathered over the years that
            are made to highlight incredible man-made constructions. While there
            are many versions of them, this website will only focus on the 7
            ancient wonders of the world. Those are: <br>
            <span class="ss-bold"
              >The Colossus of Rhodes, Gardens of Babylon, Lighthouse of
              Alexandria, the Mausoleum, the Pyramid of Giza, Statue of Zeus,
              and the temple of Artemis.</span

          <h3>Which of the 7 wonders are still standing?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Out of the 7 wonders of the world, the only one still standing is
            actually the Giza Pyramid. It was constructed over 4,500 years ago,
            and it was the tallest human-made structure for over 3,800 years!

          <h3>Why only 7?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Well, the Greeks believed that 7 is a number that represents
            perfection. At the time, there were only 5 known planets, and with
            the sun and moon it was 7 in total. This is why it's always been the
            7 wonders of the world.

          <h3>What is the point of this website?</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Mostly to inform you about the 7 wonders of the world, to explore
            the architecture and engineering that's behind them, to learn about
            their locations, their cultural significances, and so on. This is
            also my school project, so I tried to design something great. I hope
            that you have fun reading it.
