            <p>
              The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was a marvel of Greek art and architecture. This
              statue of Zeus, the king of Gods in Greek mythology, was located in the temple of Zeus, a
              sanctuary dedicated to the Olympic Games and worship of Zeus. Crafted in 5th century BC,
              and standing over 12 meters tall.

            <p>
              Created by combining ivory and gold-plated elements, the statue had an awe-inspiring 
              apperance. Zeus was depicted seated on a magnificient throne, holding a scepter in one
              hand and a smaller statue of Nike, the goddess of Victory, in the other. The king was portrayed with 
              magnificence, and his well-defined muscles serving as a symbol of power.

            <p>
              The statue served as a religious icon but also as a source of pride for the Greeks.
              Olympia was the birthplace of the Olympic games, the most important sporting event.
              The statue's presence created a divine atmosphere, empowering the greek athletes and 
              inspiring them towards greatness. Visitors from all over the world came to see the statue.

            <br />
            <p>
              Tragically, the Statue did not survive the passage of time. The decline of the Greek 
              civilization, the rise of christianity, led to the statue being destroyed in the 5th century.
              The temple that the statue was in also got destroyed, leading to numerous artifacts being lost. Today,
              only descriptions of the statue remain, perserved through ancient texts and illustrations.
