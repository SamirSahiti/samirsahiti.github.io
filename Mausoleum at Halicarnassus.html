            <p>
              The Mausoleum at Helicarnassus, known as the Tomb of Mausolus, was an ancient
              monument located in Helicarnassus, Turkey. It was comissioned by Queen Artemisia II
              in 4th century BC. This structure was a burial site for her husband (and brother...) Mausolus,
              hence the name. It honored his legacy, and symbolized the power of the Empire at the time.

            <p>
              The Mausoleum was desgined by Greek architects Pythius and Satyros, at 353 BC. Blending
              and combining various styles, it resulted in a unique blend. Standing around 45 meters tall,
              topped with a pyramid-shaped roof, crowned by a chariot and four statues of mythical figures. 
              It was also decorated with ornate treasures, as a symbol of wealth.

             The Mausoleum was not only architecturally magnificient but also showcased the remarkable skills
             of the craftsmen and artists at the time. The friezes and statues adorned the Mausoleum
             with scenes from mythology, epic battles, and cultural symbolism. This is proof of how great
             civilizations were in the past, being capable of feats which are remarkable even by today's standards.

              The Mausoleum became one of the Seven WWonders due to its architectural and artistic features. Throughout centuries,
              it captivated the imagination of intellectuals, travelers and historians. Sadly, its demise
              came in the 12th century when a series of earthquakes destroyed the majority of the structure.
              Today, while the Mausoleum exists only in ruins, it remains a testament to human igenuity,
              artistic expression, and the desire to cemmomerate loved ones in grandeur.
