              architectural marvels of the ancient world. It's the largest & oldest of the 3 Giza pyramids, and is a 
              testament to the advanced engineering of the Egyptians. Built 4,500 years ago, taking 20 years to complete, the Pyramid 
              has defied the erosion of time, making it a timeless and remarkable attraction.

            <p>
              The Pyramid of Giza is the largest and oldest of the three pyramids in
               the complex. Its original height was around 137 meters,
                making it the tallest man-made structure for thousands of years until
                 the advent of modern skyscrapers. 
                 It is composed of an estimated 2.3 million blocks, each weighing several tons. At the center 
              of the pyramid lies the burial chamber, where the Pharao's treasures and coffins were placed.

            <p>
              The Pyramid of Giza holds immense historical and cultural significance.
              It symbolized the Pharaoh's divine authority and provided a path to the afterlife.
              The pyramid also holds many unanswered mysteries. How the massive stones were
               quarried, transported, and placed with such precision continues to baffle
                researchers.
