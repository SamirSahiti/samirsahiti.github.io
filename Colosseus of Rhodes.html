            <p>
              The Colossus of Rhodes is a statue of Helios, the Sun God of
              Greece. Found on Rhodes, a small island of greece, it is one of
              the seven wonders of the world. It was built around 2300 years ago at 280 BC,
              to celebrate the succesful defense of Rhodes against invaders.

            <br />
            <p>
              It was actually quite tall, at about 33 meters high. That's the same size as 
              the statue of Liberty, from feet to crown. It might not seem like much today,
              but for its time it was extremely tall, as it was the tallest statue in the world, and for that reason
              it is one of the 7 wonders of the world.

            <br />
            <p>
              In 226 BC, 54 years after it was built, it got destroyed from an earthquake. 
              However, some parts of it remained, up until the year 653, where Muslims occupied Rhodes
              and sold all the remaining parts. There are plans to rebuild it one day,
              however nothing is confirmed.

            <br />
            <p>
              The statue was tied with Iron Tie bars, its skin built with brass plates
              and the interior itself with stone blocks. It stood on a 15 metre high marble pedastal, 
              the material for it came by melting the weapons of enemy armies. As such, you
              can consider it a symbol of war.
