              Located in the ancient city of Babylon, modern day Iraq, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
              were one of the 7 ancient wonders of the world. Described as a remarkable feat of engineering,
              due to their ascending gardens that resembled a mountain constructed by man using mud bricks.

              True beauty. Waterfalls, flowers, fruits, trees, so many things. Most notably were the amount of
              Dates ("Hurme" in Albanian), Figs, Walnuts, Plums ("Kumlla"), Pears and Grapes. The fact that such a 
              huge garden was all built, cultivated, and taken care of by Man is truly extraordinary.

            <p>
              The gardens were built by order of Nebuchadnezzar the second, a Babylonian King that ruled in the 6th century BC.
              He built the garden for his wife, Amytis of Media, who missed the green hills and valleys
              of her homeland. Others suggest that the gardens were a symbol of the king's wealth and power,
              showcasing the might of Babylon.

            <p>
              There is no concrete archeological evidence that the Hanging Gardens actually existed, because
              the Babylons were really bad at keeping documents. While the lack of physical remnants has led
              to some scholars questioning if it exists or not, the Gardens of Babylon continue to capture
              imagination as an enduring symbol of ancient marvels.
